add the proper relationship to all related object
then go into DbContext to explicitly declare relationships
example: comment 1-n post then comment has singular object Post and post has collection object Comments
then in DbContext:
builder.Entity<Post>()
                .HasMany(p => p.Comments) // 1 post to N comments (object p here is Post type)
                .WithOne(p => p.Post) // 1 comment to 1 post (object p here is Comment type)
                .HasForeignKey(p => p.PostId) //declare foreign key (object p here is Comment type)
                .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.NoAction); // Prevent cascade delete

Singular object (1 to): public <T> Related1Object;
Collection object (n to): public ICollection<T> RelatedManyObjects;
